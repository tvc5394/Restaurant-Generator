# RestaurantGenerator
Are you having a difficult time figuring out where to eat for your next meal? Look no further! You can use our RestaurantGeneratorCode.py to check out available restaurants near the Hopkins' divisions (or any location you enter!). After executing the .py file, you can choose a location, cuisine, and the minimum rating for the restaurants nearby. We will generate a list of places for you to check out!

**Motivation:**

It was 4 pm on a Wednesday, and we had to figure out our Python project proposal before leaving the classroom. What is a problem we both want to solve that can be done with Python? Ugh, we don't know. All we know is that we want to get this done and leave for food.

Hmmm, what kind of food should we get later?

Mexican? Get Chipotle? Or do we have Qdoba near us?

American? Get Honey Grow? Do we have that in this area?

Oh, wait! Let's make a restaurant generator to see what are the available restaurants nearby!

**Notes:**
- To use be able to execute the RestaurantGeneratorCode.py successfully, one needs to install [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) to their computer/laptop.
- Please also make sure the ChromeDriver is located at the same location as the RestaurantGeneratorCode.py file.
- Please note that we set the restaurant rating to 0 if it has no reviews on Google.
- Please note that there are no unittests.py files in our repository as the Google results tend to vary with each run.
